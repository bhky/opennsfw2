# Introduction

Detecting Not-Suitable-For-Work (NSFW) images is a high demand task in 
computer vision. While there are many types of NSFW images, here we focus on
the pornographic images.

The [Yahoo Open-NSFW model](https://github.com/yahoo/open_nsfw) originally
developed with the Caffe framework has been a favourite choice, but the work 
is now discontinued and Caffe is also becoming less popular.
Please see the description on the Yahoo project page for
the context, definitions, and model training details.

This **Open-NSFW 2** project provides a TensorFlow 2 implementation of the
Yahoo model, with references to its previous third-party 
[TensorFlow 1 implementation](https://github.com/mdietrichstein/tensorflow-open_nsfw).

# Installation

Python 3.7 or above is required. Tested for 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9.

The best way to install Open-NSFW 2 with its dependencies is from PyPI:
```shell
python3 -m pip install --upgrade opennsfw2
```
Alternatively, to obtain the latest version from this repository:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:bhky/opennsfw2.git
cd opennsfw2
python3 -m pip install .
```

# Usage

```python
import numpy as np
import opennsfw2 as n2
from PIL import Image

# Load and preprocess image.
image_path = "path/to/your/image.jpg"
pil_image = Image.open(image_path)
image = n2.preprocess_image(pil_image, n2.Preprocessing.YAHOO)
# The preprocessed image is a NumPy array of shape (224, 224, 3).

# Create the model.
# By default, this call will search for the pre-trained weights file from path:
# $HOME/.opennsfw2/weights/open_nsfw_weights.h5
# If not exists, the file will be downloaded from this repository.
# The model is a `tf.keras.Model` object.
model = n2.make_open_nsfw_model()

# Make predictions.
inputs = np.expand_dims(image, axis=0)  # Add batch axis (for single image).
predictions = model.predict(inputs)

# The shape of predictions is (batch_size, 2).
# Each row gives [sfw_probability, nsfw_probability] of an input image, e.g.:
sfw_probability, nsfw_probability = predictions[0]
```
Alternatively, the end-to-end pipeline function can be used:

```python
import opennsfw2 as n2

image_paths = [
  "path/to/your/image1.jpg",
  "path/to/your/image2.jpg",
  # ...
]

predictions = n2.predict_images(
  image_paths, batch_size=4, preprocessing=n2.Preprocessing.YAHOO
)
```

# API

### `preprocess_image`
Apply necessary preprocessing to the input image.
- Parameters:
  - `pil_image` (`PIL.Image`): Input as a Pillow image.
  - `preprocessing` (`Preprocessing` enum, default `Preprocessing.YAHOO`): 
    See [preprocessing details](#preprocessing-details).
- Return:
  - NumPy array of shape `(224, 224, 3)`.

### `Preprocessing`
Enum class for preprocessing options.
- `Preprocessing.YAHOO`
- `Preprocessing.SIMPLE`

### `make_open_nsfw_model`
Create an instance of the NSFW model, optionally with pre-trained weights from Yahoo.
- Parameters:
  - `input_shape` (`Tuple[int, int, int]`, default `(224, 224, 3)`):
    Input shape of the model, this should not be changed.
  - `weights_path` (`Optional[str]`, default `$HOME/.opennsfw/weights/open_nsfw_weights.h5`): 
    Path to the weights in HDF5 format to be loaded by the model. 
    The weights file will be downloaded if not exists.
    Users can provide path if the default is not preferred. 
    If `None`, no weights will be downloaded nor loaded to the model.
- Return:
  - `tf.keras.Model` object.

### `predict_images`
End-to-end pipeline function from input image paths to predictions.
- Parameters:
  - `image_paths` (`Sequence[str]`): List of paths to input image files.
  - `batch_size` (`int`, default `32`): Batch size to be used for model inference.
  - `preprocessing`: Same as that in `preprocess_image`.
  - `weights_path`: Same as that in `make_open_nsfw_model`.
- Return:
  - NumPy array of shape `(batch_size, 2)`, each row gives 
    `[sfw_probability, nsfw_probability]` of an input image.

# Preprocessing details

## Options

This implementation provides the following preprocessing options.
- `YAHOO`: The default option which was used in the original 
  [Yahoo's Caffe](https://github.com/yahoo/open_nsfw/blob/master/classify_nsfw.py#L19-L80) 
  and the later 
  [TensorFlow 1](https://github.com/mdietrichstein/tensorflow-open_nsfw/blob/master/image_utils.py#L4-L53) 
  implementations. The key steps are:
  - Resize the input Pillow image to `(256, 256)`.
  - Save the image as JPEG bytes and reload again to a NumPy image 
    (this step is mysterious, but somehow it really makes a difference).
  - Crop the centre part of the NumPy image with size `(224, 224)`.
  - Swap the colour channels to BGR.
  - Subtract the training dataset mean value of each channel: `[104, 117, 123]`.
- `SIMPLE`: A simpler and probably more intuitive preprocessing option is also provided,
  but note that the model output probabilities will be different.
  The key steps are:
  - Resize the input Pillow image to `(224, 224)`.
  - Convert to a NumPy image.
  - Swap the colour channels to BGR.
  - Subtract the training dataset mean value of each channel: `[104, 117, 123]`.

## Comparison

Using 521 private images, the NSFW probabilities given by 
three different settings are compared:
- [TensorFlow 1 implementation](https://github.com/mdietrichstein/tensorflow-open_nsfw) with `YAHOO` preprocessing.
- TensorFlow 2 implementation with `YAHOO` preprocessing.
- TensorFlow 2 implementation with `SIMPLE` preprocessing.

The following figure shows the result:

![NSFW probabilities comparison](docs/nsfw_probabilities_comparison.png)

The current TensorFlow 2 implementation with `YAHOO` preprocessing
can totally reproduce the well-tested TensorFlow 1 result, 
with small floating point errors only.

With `SIMPLE` preprocessing the results are different, where the model tends 
to give lower probabilities.
